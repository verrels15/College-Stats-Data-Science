Question - Is it ethical to compare the stats of teams that have different amounts of money/resources to use for the
sport?
We believe that comparing the stats of all D1 teams in unethical because these conferences all consist of teams that
range from having millions to only hundreds of thousands of dollars to apply to their basketball programs. Since it is
safe to assume that the schools/conferences that have more money in their programs can better prepare their athletes, is
it fair to compare them to the programs that aren't as privileged? How is it fair that we expect the HBCUs like Texas
Southern that have more troubles to compare to PWIs like Texas that spend a large amount of their budget on sports? It
is not. The fact that teams like Prairie View get paid to play teams like Texas A&M is a very poor attempt by the NCAA
level the playing field between schools that have a very clear resource gap. I think if the NCAA did a better job of
spreading money and resources among D1 schools (and more but D1 is the focus in this project), the stats would be a lot
closer and a fairer comparison of skill at D1 schools.
